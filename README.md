## Reuse

This tool is primarily a demo, but it operates using the [DADAlytics NER API gateway](https://github.com/SemanticLab/DADAlytics-docker-ner-gateway). If you have that server running you would simply need to change all references to "https://nerserver.semlab.io" in the `index.html` to your own server IP/URL.
